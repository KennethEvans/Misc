<h4>Previous</h4>

<h4>Next</h4>
<p>Navigates to the next message (up in the list).</p>
<h4>Delete</h4>
<p>Deletes the message and displays the next one.</p>
<h4>Fix Time </h4>
<p>Brings up a dialog to set the desired  change for the time stamp in hours and minutes. The intial value for the change is your time zone offset, which is often the correct value. However, you may not want to use that. Whatever time you enter will be remembered for the next time, whether you cancel or not. If you click OK, the changes will be made or simulated, depending on the current setting for Dry Run. </p>
<h4>Set Dry Run </h4>
<p>Allows you to set whether fixing the time will be a dry run or a real change to the database. In the case of a dry run, a popup will inform you of the change that would have been made, but no changes are actually made. </p>
<h4>Help</h4>
